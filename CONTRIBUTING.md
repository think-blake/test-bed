## Before Adding Patterns

Consult the team at large! We'll help you determine if an existing pattern already meets your needs. If a new pattern is needed, a quick code design meeting ahead of time will keep your changes on everyone's radar, as well as smooth along the code review process!

## Creating your branch

Please create all branches off of the `main` branch. The following commands will ensure you have the latest changes in your new branch:

1. First, make sure you have the latest changes:
   - `git checkout main`
   - `git pull`
2. Then, create your branch!
   - `git checkout -b feature/your-branch-name`

That's it! Make sure you follow the branch naming conventions below.

### **Branch naming conventions**

Do: Make sure you use a short, descriptive name!

```sh
# good
git checkout -b oauth-migration

# too vague
git checkout -b login_fix
```

Do: Make all efforts to keep branch names lower-cased

Do: Use one of the following prefixes for your branch name:

1. `feature/`
2. `component/`
3. `fix/`
4. `release/`
5. `refactor/`

```sh
# good
git checkout -b feature/reduced-motion-toggle
git checkout -b component/key-takeaways

# no prefix
git checkout -b key-takeaways
```

## Updating your branch from `main`

It's always best to make sure your branch is up-to-date with `main` before committing more work. Do this by **rebasing against main**, instead of merging main in.

```sh
git rebase main
```

This arranges all of your commits to appear after `main`'s latest commit.

## Merging your changes

To merge your changes into `main`, make a pull request and assign a reviewer. There should be a minimum of one reviewer on every pull request.

## PR Acceptance

PRs can be merged after a successful review!

Make sure to check "delete this branch" to remove the remote branch, unless otherwise noted. Don't forget to keep your local branches clean by remembering to periodically run `git fetch --prune`.

Happy coding! ðŸ˜„
